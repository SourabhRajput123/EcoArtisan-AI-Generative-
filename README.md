# EcoArtisan AI - Sustainable Innovation Idea Generator

EcoArtisan AI is an AI-powered idea generator designed to provide innovative business ideas that align with sustainability and environmental objectives. The model generates ideas based on input questions related to eco-friendly practices, helping to inspire new business models in industries like fashion, technology, packaging, and more.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Idea Generation**: Uses a trained LSTM-based neural network to generate business ideas based on the provided prompts.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple web interface where users can input their questions and receive generated ideas.
- **Sustainable Focus**: Designed to promote eco-friendly and sustainable business practices by offering creative solutions.

## How It Works

1. **Input Question**: Users enter a question related to sustainable business ideas.
2. **Generate Idea**: The system processes the input using a trained LSTM model to generate a response.
3. **Output**: The AI generates a new, innovative business idea based on the input provided.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python, TensorFlow/Keras for model training and inference.
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (simple form to accept user input and display results).
- **Model**: LSTM-based neural network with embedding layers to process and generate text.
- **Data**: Uses a JSON dataset (`data.json`) consisting of titles and descriptions of eco-friendly business ideas for training.

## Dataset

The dataset (`data.json`) contains titles and descriptions of various eco-friendly business ideas. These are used for training the model to understand the context of sustainability-related questions.

### Example Entry:
```json
{
  "ideas": [
    {
      "title": "Sustainable Packaging Solutions",
      "description": "Develop biodegradable packaging materials to reduce plastic waste and environmental impact."
    },
    {
      "title": "Eco-Friendly Fashion",
      "description": "Create clothing lines using recycled materials to promote sustainability in the fashion industry."
    }
  ]
}
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecoartisan-ai.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ecoartisan-ai
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the app:
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```

5. Open a browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to interact with the Idea Generator.

## Usage

- Enter a question related to sustainable business ideas (e.g., "What are some innovative ideas for sustainable packaging?").
- Click **Generate Idea** to get a unique idea generated by the AI model.

## Model Training

To train or fine-tune the model:

1. Add or update the `data.json` with new ideas.
2. Run the `model.py` script to train the model:
   ```bash
   python model.py
   ```
3. The model will generate new business ideas based on your dataset.
